**Guess My Number!** is a responsive web application that gamifies the classic "higher or lower" logic puzzle. Designed with a retro arcade aesthetic, the project serves as a showcase for modern DOM manipulation techniques and state management using vanilla JavaScript.

### Core Features
- **Logic Engine:** Random number generation between 1–20.
- **Real-time UI:** Instant feedback on user guesses via DOM updates.
- **Session Persistence:** Highscore tracking that persists until the browser is refreshed.
- **Visual Feedback:** Dynamic CSS styling changes (background color and element scaling) triggered by game events.
